# Swap

**Why aren't my swapped assets showing in my Account Balances?**

Assets are swapped into your connected wallet, not Mango Markets Account.

**Why do my swap balances not match my Account balances?**

Swaps occur in connected wallet and separate from your Mango Markets Account. The swap balances are reflective of your wallet balances.

**What exchange does the swap use?**

Swap feature is an integration of Jupiter Aggregator. Jupiter checks for the best prices and routes across all Solana dApps to give you the best price.
