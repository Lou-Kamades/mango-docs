## **Borrowing on Mango Markets** ðŸ¥­

First, ensure assets are [deposited into your margin account](https://docs.mango.markets/tutorials/getting-started#creating-a-margin-account-and-depositing-funds) for use as collateral. Then, simply click "Withdraw" under the _Accounts_ tab or "Borrow" under the _Borrow_ tab.

The UI will prompt you to select the asset that you wish to withdraw and borrow, and toggle "Borrow Funds" on.

Next, determine the amount you would like to withdraw. Remember, borrowing funds affects your [collateral ratio](https://app.gitbook.com/@blockworksfoundation/s/mango/\~/drafts/-MZPLylXCNfAFWlrfxMI/tutorials/trade-on-mango.markets#how-to-trade-with-leverage) and leverage calculation. If you would like to withdraw the maximum amount with collateral ratio above maintenance margin threshold, click "Max with borrow." An estimated leverage post-withdraw is displayed.

Interest is paid on your borrows continuously from your deposits. Please monitor interest rates as they recalculate based on pool utilisation.
