# â›µ Drifting Mango

### What is Drifting Mango?

Drifting Mango is a program that looks at the price of SOL-PERP on Mango Markets and Drift Protocol;

If a difference in price becomes wide enough, the program tries to open a position on both sides of the book, using both platforms, in order to close the price gap and make a profit.

For example, if Mango Markets is selling at 260 and Drift is selling at 230, it will open a short position on Mango Markets and a long position on Drift (in one transaction!)
