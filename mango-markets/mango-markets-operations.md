Admin



Security admin

Every mango group has a security admin. A security admin can currently disable any mango instruction and can bring tokens or markets to reduce only mode. The security admin on the primary mango group will be a realms [multi sig wallet](https://app.realms.today/realms/new/multisig). The multi sig should be formed by various mango dao members who are geographically well distributed. The membership will be reviewed periodically to ensure that members have been active or will be active in future.
