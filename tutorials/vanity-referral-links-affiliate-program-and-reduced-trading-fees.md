# ðŸ’¸ Referral links, affiliate program and reduced trading fees

Mango Markets allows for traders to create a unique referral link to share with their friends or to use for "self-referral" based on MNGO holdings.

To be eligible for creating a vanity referral link, a trader needs to maintain a balance of 10,000 MNGO in their mango account balance.

To create a referral link once you have 10,000 MNGO, navigate to the following URL in the UI and connect your wallet:

``[`https://trade.mango.markets/referral`](https://trade.mango.markets/referral)``

![Feel free to create your own vanity link for sharing, duplicates are not possible](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-20 01.50.45.png>)

**Important notes:**

* Your referral code is automatically applied when a user creates a Mango Markets Account using your link.
* When any of your referrals trade Mango Markets Perpetual Futures, you earn 16% of their trade fees. (0.8bps on taker fees).
* Plus, for using your link they get a 4% discount off their Mango Markets Perpetual Futures fees. (0.2bps on taker fees).
* If your referee owns 10,000 MNGO, they will act as a self-referral and no longer contribute to your affiliate earnings. Instead, they will pay 4bps taker fee instead of 4.8bps.

#### Example of referral link/self referral usage

Payoffs/scenarios are as follows:

Max refers Klossie, who takes from Daffy:\
Klossie pays 4.8bps taker fee, Daffy gets 3bps maker rebate, Max gets 0.8bps, DAO gets 1bp of revenue.

Klossie now has 10k MNGO (LP mining / buys), takes again from Daffy:\
Klossie pays 4bps taker, Daffy gets 3bps maker rebate, DAO gets 1bp of revenue.

Crusher has no MNGO, not referred, takes from Daffy:\
Crusher pays 5bps taker fee, Daffy gets 3bps maker rebate, DAO gets 2bps of revenue.
