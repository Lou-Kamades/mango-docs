## **Borrowing on Mango** ðŸ¥­

First, ensure assets are [deposited into your margin account](https://docs.mango.markets/tutorials/getting-started#creating-a-margin-account-and-depositing-funds) for use as collateral. Then, simply click 'Withdraw' under the accounts tab or "Borrow" under the _Borrow_ tab.

The UI will prompt you to select the asset you wish to withdraw and borrow, and toggle 'Borrow Funds on.

Next, determine the amount you'd like to withdraw. Remember, borrowing funds affects your [collateral ratio](https://app.gitbook.com/@blockworksfoundation/s/mango/\~/drafts/-MZPLylXCNfAFWlrfxMI/tutorials/trade-on-mango.markets#how-to-trade-with-leverage) and leverage calculation. If you'd like to withdraw the maximum amount with collateral ratio above maintenance margin threshold, click 'Max with borrow'. An estimated leverage post-withdraw is displayed.

Interest is paid on your borrows continuously from your deposits. Please monitor interest rates as they recalculate based on pool utilisation.

**To repay your loan, deposit or trade for the borrowed asset.**
