## **Borrowing on** ðŸ¥­

First, ensure assets are [deposited into your margin account](https://docs.mango.markets/tutorials/getting-started#creating-a-margin-account-and-depositing-funds) for use as collateral. Then, simply click 'Withdraw' under the accounts tab or "Borrow" under the _Borrow_ tab.&#x20;

The UI will prompt you to select the asset you wish to withdraw and borrow, and toggle 'Borrow Funds' on.&#x20;

Next, determine the amount you'd like to withdraw. Remember, borrowing funds affects your [collateral ratio](https://app.gitbook.com/@blockworksfoundation/s/mango/\~/drafts/-MZPLylXCNfAFWlrfxMI/tutorials/trade-on-mango.markets#how-to-trade-with-leverage) and leverage calculation. If you'd like to withdraw the maximum amount with collateral ratio above maintenance margin threshold, click 'Max with borrow'. An estimated leverage post-withdraw is displayed.&#x20;

Interest is paid on your borrows continuously from your deposits. Please monitor interest rates as they recalculate based on pool utilization.&#x20;

**To repay your loan, deposit or trade for the borrowed asset.**
