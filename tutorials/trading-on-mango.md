## Placing a Trade on Mango ðŸ¥­

To place an order, first decide if you want to Buy or Sell an asset.

Note when placing limit orders, the options of POST and IOC.

* When IOC (Immediate or Cancel) is selected - if an order is placed and not filled within seconds, it's cancelled.
* When POST is selected, limit orders are added to the order book and earn maker fees if filled.
* POST orders will always be the 'maker' and will automatically cancel if not.

Limit orders open an order at a set price. If the price action of an asset in the order book reaches that price (or better), the order will be filled.

Market orders hit the book immediately on the bid or ask side depending on if you bought or sold, the position then fills at an average price of the orders taken.

Spot margined positions can be viewed under your accounts tab within your portfolio view under "Balances", Perpetual positions can be viewed.

**For Spot margined markets** to make a leveraged trade, place an order with a size greater than your deposit value; funds are automatically borrowed or utilise the leverage slider to decide your risk or don't worry about margin or leverage at all and treat it as a spot market; Simply exchange for the even value of another asset.

**For perpetual futures markets**, to make a leveraged trade is very similar, except you are not buying the asset in question, you are simply buying exposure to that asset and its price movements. Positions can be viewed under the perp positions tab below or under the accounts tab.

## Spot Margined Markets

Mango and its spot margined markets are built on top of the Serum DEX ecosystem. Mango's risk engine allows users to trade Serem DEX's orderbooks with up to 5x leverage.

## Perpetual Futures Markets

Mango also offers perpetual futures built on the Mango protocol with its own order book. Trade with up to 10x leverage and enjoy permissionless price exposure to any of the assets in the Mango group.

## Mango ðŸ¥­ **pays the Lowest Fees**

Mango traders save substantially on Serum DEX trading fees by pooling SRM together in Mango. Serum's tier structure determines fee rates based on the amount of SRM held in an account; the more SRM in an account, the less you pay in fees and the more you earn as a maker. The highest tier is 1 MegaSerum (MSRM) and unrealistic for most people to obtain.

Luckily, Mango utilises a generously deposited MSRM so that all users collectively reach the highest tier and benefit together when trading on the platform.

## **Swap**
